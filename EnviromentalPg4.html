	<!--List of Things-->
	<ul>
		<li><h3>I reuse by bubble tea cups and straws as much as possible</h3><p>If I'm out of town, it's hard to do this but when I know that I will be around bubble tea, I bring my cup and straw along just in case. Some bubble tea shops will even give you a discount for reusing your cup!</p></li>
		<li><h3>I compost my leftover food scraps, my used tissues, and paper coffee cups</h3><p>If there is not a compost bin around me, I will often put my cup in the car and then throw it away when I get home</p></li>
		<li><h3>This year I'm trying to buy less cheap clothing at fast fashion stores like H&M and Forever 21</h3><p>I will get shirts if they feel like decent quality that won't fall apart imediatly in the wash.</p></li>
