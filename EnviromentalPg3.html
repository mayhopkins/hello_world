    <h3>People all over the world are trying to coming up with new innovative ways to be more green. I hope that that you will find inspiration that will motivate you. Being more environmentally friendly is a personal choice to help you feel better. Some of these methods could even help save you money!</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><h3>Purchase a more eco-friendly vehicle such as a hybrid or electric car.</h3>
        <p>A hybrid car uses less gas, therefore you could save a lot of money while saving the environment. Here are some good cars:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Toyota Prius is a hybrid and can get up to 54mpg</li>
          <li>The Kia Niro is a hybrid that can either be gas or electric. It can get up to 50mpg.</li>
          <li>The Chevrolet Volt is well regarded electric car</li>
          <li>The Chevrolet Bolt is also a well regarded car with a little higher mile range (but more expensive)</li>

          <p>Here is an older generation Toyota Prius, you can save money by getting an older model. Toyota is a pretty reliable company as well as their prius model.</p>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><h3>Eat local, seasonal and organic meats and produce.</h3>
        <p>Eating green and local can boost your economy and help to reduce green house gasses that are used to un-naturally grow and produce food. It's also good for your personal health to not eat too many chemicals.</p></li>
      <li><h3>Keep some reusable bags in the back of your car</h3>
        <p>Single-use bags just sit around your house and then become trash. There is no need for them. A reusable bag is great because they don't just become trash after one use as well as they are stronger than paper and plastic bags. It can be hard to always remember a reusable bag.</p></li>
      <li><h3>Try to compost as much as possible</h3>
        <p>After you are finished eating, compost the scraps! There is no need for things that can be made back into dirt to be sent to the landfill.</p></li>
    <!--Overall should make you happier-->
      <li><h3>Going green should make you feel happy.</h3>
        <p>You will feel a sense of accomplishment, which will make you feel like a better person</p>
